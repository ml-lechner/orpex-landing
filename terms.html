<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
<p class="updated">Last updated: February 17, 2025</p>

<p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Orpex platform and services provided by Orpex Technologies, Inc. ("Orpex," "we," "us," or "our"). By accessing or using our Service at orpex.ai, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

<h2>1. The Service</h2>
<p>Orpex provides an AI-powered operating system for startups, including company formation assistance, AI agent operations (finance, compliance, GTM, and operations), third-party integrations, and related tools and features (collectively, the "Service").</p>

<h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
<p>You must be at least 18 years old and have the legal authority to enter into these Terms. If you are using the Service on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind that entity to these Terms.</p>

<h2>3. Account Registration</h2>
<p>You must provide accurate and complete information when creating an account. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activities that occur under your account. You must notify us immediately at <a href="mailto:security@orpex.ai">security@orpex.ai</a> if you suspect unauthorized access.</p>

<h2>4. Acceptable Use</h2>
<p>You agree not to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use the Service for any illegal purpose or in violation of any applicable laws</li>
  <li>Provide false or misleading information during company formation</li>
  <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to other users' data or our systems</li>
  <li>Interfere with or disrupt the Service or its infrastructure</li>
  <li>Use the Service to send spam, harass others, or distribute malicious content</li>
  <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble any part of the Service</li>
  <li>Resell, sublicense, or redistribute the Service without our written permission</li>
  <li>Use the AI agents for purposes that violate applicable laws or regulations</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Company Formation Services</h2>
<p>Orpex facilitates company formation through third-party partners. We are not a law firm and do not provide legal advice. The formation service is subject to the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Formation timelines are estimates and may vary based on state processing times</li>
  <li>You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of all information submitted</li>
  <li>State filing fees and registered agent fees may apply in addition to our service fees</li>
  <li>Formation completion is subject to approval by the relevant state authority</li>
</ul>
<p>We recommend consulting with a qualified attorney for legal questions related to your company structure, equity agreements, and compliance obligations.</p>

<h2>6. AI Agent Services</h2>

<h3>6.1 Nature of AI Agents</h3>
<p>Our AI agents are software tools that perform operational tasks using artificial intelligence. While designed to be reliable and useful, they are not substitutes for professional legal, financial, or tax advice. AI agents may occasionally produce inaccurate or incomplete results.</p>

<h3>6.2 Authority and Oversight</h3>
<p>AI agents operate within predefined authority levels. High-impact actions are escalated to you for approval through the operational inbox. You are ultimately responsible for reviewing and approving agent actions that affect your company, finances, or legal standing.</p>

<h3>6.3 Third-Party Actions</h3>
<p>When AI agents interact with third-party services on your behalf (e.g., filing taxes, sending emails, configuring tools), you authorize these actions. You are responsible for the consequences of actions taken by agents within the authority you grant.</p>

<h2>7. Integrations</h2>
<p>The Service allows you to connect third-party services (Gmail, Slack, banking, etc.). Your use of these integrations is subject to the respective third-party terms of service. We are not responsible for the availability, accuracy, or reliability of third-party services. You may disconnect any integration at any time.</p>

<h2>8. Fees and Payment</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Subscription Plans:</strong> The Service is offered in tiered subscription plans as described on our pricing page. Fees are billed monthly in advance.</li>
  <li><strong>Free Tier:</strong> The Starter plan is offered free of charge with limited features as described.</li>
  <li><strong>Design Partner Program:</strong> During the design partner program, paid plans may be offered at no cost. We reserve the right to begin billing with 30 days' notice.</li>
  <li><strong>Changes:</strong> We may change pricing with 30 days' notice. Existing subscriptions will honor their current rate through the end of the billing period.</li>
  <li><strong>Refunds:</strong> Subscription fees are generally non-refundable. We may offer refunds or credits at our discretion.</li>
</ul>

<h2>9. Intellectual Property</h2>

<h3>9.1 Our IP</h3>
<p>The Service, including its software, design, trademarks, and content, is owned by Orpex Technologies, Inc. and protected by intellectual property laws. Nothing in these Terms grants you ownership of or rights to our intellectual property beyond the limited license to use the Service.</p>

<h3>9.2 Your Content</h3>
<p>You retain ownership of all data, documents, and content you submit to the Service ("Your Content"). You grant us a limited, non-exclusive license to use Your Content solely to provide and improve the Service. We will not use Your Content for purposes unrelated to the Service.</p>

<h3>9.3 Generated Content</h3>
<p>Documents, reports, and other materials generated by our AI agents on your behalf ("Generated Content") are owned by you. We make no representations or warranties about the legal sufficiency, accuracy, or completeness of Generated Content. You are responsible for reviewing all Generated Content before relying on it.</p>

<h2>10. Privacy</h2>
<p>Your use of the Service is subject to our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>, which describes how we collect, use, and protect your information.</p>

<h2>11. Disclaimers</h2>
<p><strong>THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</strong></p>
<p>Without limiting the foregoing:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We do not guarantee that AI agents will produce accurate, complete, or error-free results</li>

  <li>We are not responsible for decisions made based on AI agent outputs without independent verification</li>
  <li>We do not provide legal, financial, or tax advice</li>
</ul>

<h2>12. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p><strong>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ORPEX SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, OR GOODWILL, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY.</strong></p>
<p>Our total aggregate liability for all claims arising from or related to the Service shall not exceed the greater of (a) the amount you paid us in the 12 months preceding the claim, or (b) $100.</p>

<h2>13. Indemnification</h2>
<p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Orpex and its officers, directors, employees, and agents from any claims, damages, losses, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from (a) your use of the Service, (b) your violation of these Terms, (c) your violation of any third-party rights, or (d) actions taken by AI agents on your behalf within the authority you granted.</p>

<h2>14. Termination</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>By You:</strong> You may cancel your account at any time through Settings or by contacting us. Cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing period.</li>
  <li><strong>By Us:</strong> We may suspend or terminate your account for violation of these Terms, non-payment, or if required by law, with notice where practicable.</li>
  <li><strong>Effect:</strong> Upon termination, your right to use the Service ceases. We will make your data available for export for 30 days following termination, after which it may be deleted.</li>
</ul>

<h2>15. Dispute Resolution</h2>
<p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to conflict of law principles. Any disputes arising from these Terms shall be resolved exclusively in the state or federal courts located in Delaware. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of these courts.</p>

<h2>16. Changes to These Terms</h2>
<p>We may update these Terms from time to time. Material changes will be communicated via email or through the Service at least 30 days before they take effect. Continued use of the Service after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

<h2>17. General</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Entire Agreement:</strong> These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and Orpex.</li>
  <li><strong>Severability:</strong> If any provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in effect.</li>
  <li><strong>No Waiver:</strong> Our failure to enforce any provision does not waive our right to do so later.</li>
  <li><strong>Assignment:</strong> You may not assign your rights under these Terms without our consent. We may assign our rights freely.</li>
</ul>
